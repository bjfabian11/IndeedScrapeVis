# IndeedScrapeVis
Python web application accesses Indeed job postings and create visualizations using keywords

Using Python, Flask, BeautifulSoup, and Bokeh visualizations

This project I wanted to practice using Python, work with Indeed job postings, and learn how to create visualization from data.

This application will have a webview of Indeed where you can run a general search, which will turn into a CSV file.

From there the user can enter keywords and the application will count job postings with the keywords occurences in the CSV file.

Then the CSV file will be analyzed and the keyword counts will be plotted and labelled to understand keyword correlations.
